# React Native Web Boilerplate 🥘

A small and simple boilerplate for lazy people to create a universal Web/Native React app. How is that possible? By code sharing between both of those worlds. The most crucial element of this puzzle is a brilliant [React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) library by [Nicolas Gallagher](http://nicolasgallagher.com).

This boilerplate will save you the hassle of configuring it by your own. Like I said. Lazy bones.

> There's also version with app navigation built in. Check it out here [Check it out here](https://github.com/inspmoore/rnw_boilerplate_nav)!

## Installing 🔩

Clone the repo and run

```
yarn
```

or

```
npm install
```

to install all the dependencies.

## Scripts ️️️⚙️

The scripts are a mix of [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#npm-start-or-yarn-start) and [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started).

### `yarn start-web` or `npm run start-web`

Runs your app in the browser under the http://localhost:3000.

### `yarn start` or `npm run start`

Starts metro bundler for your react native project.

### `yarn start-ios` or `npm run start-ios`

Runs metro bundler and opens the app in the iOS simulator.

### `yarn build` or `npm run build`

Builds your web app for production.

### `yarn test` or `npm run test`

Runs the test environment for the native part.

### `yarn test-web` or `npm run test-web`

Runs the test environment for the web part.

### `yarn eject` or `npm run eject`

Eject your web project to your custom setup.

## Usage 🛠

Folder and file structure is also a result of combination of create-react-app and react-native boilerplates.

```
rnw_boilerplate
├── android
├── ios
├── node_modules
├── public
├── src
│    ├── App.js
│    ├── App.native.js
│    ├── HomeScreen.js
│    ├── index.js - web index file
│    └── registerServiceWorker.js
├── app.json
├── index.js - native index file
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

`HomeScreen.js` file is an example of a component shared between the platforms. Thanks to React Native Web lib, it is possible to use React Native primitives in the Web environment. Please check out [RNW guide](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) for more details.

Also notice that there are separate `App.js` files for Web and Native. This gives a lot of advantages, including adding platform specific libraries to your app.

## Renaming the app ✏️

This boilerplate comes with ios and android bundles already named. If you want to (and you should) change the name, use the [react-native-rename](https://github.com/junedomingo/react-native-rename) lib.

## Contribution ❤️

This boilerplate was made for my own convenience and is still a work in progress. Please consider it as an experiment and think twice or even trice (is that a word?) before using it in production.

If you however would like to add something from yourself, please do make a PR! All contributions will be treated with great love!
